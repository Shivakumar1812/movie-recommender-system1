# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that builds a **Movie Recommender System** using Python. The goal of this project is to recommend movies to users based on their preferences using content-based filtering techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Recommends similar movies based on movie descriptions
- Uses content-based filtering (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation
- Ideal for beginners in machine learning and data science

## 📁 Project Structure

- `movie_recommender.py` or `notebook.ipynb` – Main code for the recommender system
- `movies.csv` – Dataset containing movie titles and metadata
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Similarity Metrics (Cosine Similarity)
- Content-Based Recommendation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
